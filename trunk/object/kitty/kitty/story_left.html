    <td height="350" align="left" valign="top"><p><strong>It all started on 2004. </strong></p>
      <p>Just right after college and following my dad’s advice, I packed by suitcases and came to shanghai. It was a simple plan, studying the language, then, a master and after 2 years I would be back in Colombia (its been more than 6 years and who knows how many other years are ahead) </p>
      <p>The first thing I thought, it was to make friends in the introduction class, among many students I will find my best friend. As any dedicated student, I arrived early to the classroom. Almost all were Japanese and Koreans (meaning: no English) and at the back of the classroom, a group of fins (they already had a group, and me, alone like a mushroom!!). The teacher arrives, the class starts and after almost 20 minutes, suddenly appears an Italian (Chris), who is agitated (of running I guess) with his long hair all around his face and with such a shame, that he could only apologize and move into the classroom. The first thing I thought “terrible! How come he is so late at the first day, I’m pretty sure he is one of those who do everything but studying (then, to be regretted of my words, as he was in a more advanced level than me!)</p>
      <p>As the class was over, he comes closer and we started to talk (not sure if it’s the right word, because I couldn’t understand anything. I’m saying it because instead of speaking in English he chooses Chinese!). That was the first time I saw Chris and “kind” of (actually its try to) talk with him. It’s confirmed, at least our story is not love at first sight.<br />
          <br />
        Time passes and he makes different friends from those I have made. Occasionally we met at the campus and greet each other with a very informal “HI”. <br />
        Finally I found a friend who can speak Spanish, the famous SNOW, who also knows Chris. That was how we started to have friends in common and up grade our informal “Hi” into ‘Hi” with subsequent conversation.</p>
      <p>Now, the second change. We go for a bowling night with some friends. Chris in one side and I in another. As always, with my roll of cupid, I started to convince my friend Snow to like Chris: “its not bad, he is interesting, seems smart, can understand a bit of Spanish… why not?” (Its clear this guy is not for me)</p>
      <p>After the bowling, we all go together for a nice dinner. We sat together and started to chat (finally this time in English). Dinner is over, we go to another place, the chat is still going,  … the meeting is over, we say goodbye and still, not even a clue of nothing! Confirmed once again that it wasn’t a second sight love story.<br />
      </p>
      <p>Finally, third time lucky! We met again at the campus and realized we have a dinner with common friends, so we just decided to meet at the main gate. Same as the beginning of this story, I arrived on time and he is running late again!. We waited and waited until finally he appears riding a bike, with a hat on his head. He stops, get off from the bike, takes out the hat and greets… there! There it was! It was the first time I started to like him, he had cut his hair!! A totally different guy with these huge blue eyes and lovely smile. </p>
      <p>At the dinner, it seemed like nobody existed, we talked all night long! The dinner is over, we go back to the campus and starts an endless conversation trough mobile messages. From daily messages we passed to dates, from dates to a formal relationship, from a formal relationship to live together, and, from living together we became to what we are now, an incredible couple, ready to start a lovely family.</p>
    <p>PS: If you already read christian’s version, please note that currently he has 60% of the closet. </p></td>
