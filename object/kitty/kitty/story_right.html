      <p>It was early 2004 and I was coming to Shanghai after six months of intense Chinese studying in Dalian, a city north-east of Beijing. I chose a rather unknown place so that I could learn quickly: that is just like teaching somebody how to swim by pushing him into the deep sea and telling him “ok, now just don`t sink!”. Fortunately in those six months I managed to stay afloat (though I drank quite a lot of water at the beginning); at the end of the semester I was nonetheless relieved to go back to the civilized world, where people could use sounds that were not only strokes and accents but sounded similar to what the most call English.<br />
        It was the end of January and I decided to register for a couple more months of Chinese lessons. I remember I arrived quite late to the first introductory class as I was probably thinking “C`mon, I`ve been living for six months at the outpost of civilization, I certainly don`t need the usual prep where professor teach scared white students how to use the chopsticks!”. Anyway, that day I didn`t have much to do so I thought it might be worth checking it out.  Few people actually showed up: a gang of fins, a bunch of bananas (i.e. Chinese borne in western countries) and maybe somebody else, I don’t remember exactly. What I do remember is that it was the first time I met Kitty. <br />
        We started to talk and, as always happens in the best love stories, I was actually pretty annoyed by her as she could not really catch much of my Chinese: after all my studying in frost-biting Dalian, it was just not fair! Anyway, I decided not to take it too personally: after all, she has been living abroad since she was borne and it was not her fault if her comprehension lagged behind. <br />
        We spent few more days before we started to have some common friends (you remember … the scared fins who could not use the chopstick of the first day!) but at the end we had the chance to get together again. In the meantime I have moved out from the student house into a proper apartment, so I was happy at playing the cool guy while most of the others were living at the kinder-garden dorm under the safe watch of the teachers. One night we had a small party there and that`s when me and Kitty started to connect a little bit more, cracking jokes at Vincent, a Malaysian guy who started to hear voices after just few beers. After that, we got out a few more times, always along with some other friends. <br />
        Memory fades (mine very easily indeed) so if you want to read more details about where, when, who, what, how, why, which color I was wearing at the bowling day or which drink I ordered at the German restaurant … well, you better read Kitty`s story. What I remember though is that spring was coming and this is normally mating season for most of the mammals on earth (it actually last 12 months a year for Italians). On my mating radar I earmarked Kitty and another Japanese girl: they were both pretty, reasonably small (my dad always joked about my fancy with pocket-girlfriend) and they seemed to have some corresponding feeling (spring works both ways).<br />
        If you have logged on this site, I guess you can clearly guess who was the lucky winner (either you think that the winner is the person who is marrying me or the person that avoided it): after a coffee there was a date, after the date there was a sweet goodnight, after that there was the first kiss and after few months she moved in my place and took half of my closet! Though many other couples might have met in a similar way, what it never stops to surprise me is the long list of coincidences that made our paths starting from so far away, crossing at one point and move together from that point on. It is a mix of strange choices, lucky events, risk-taking and coincidences that is what makes our story just … awesome. <br />
